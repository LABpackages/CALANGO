KOMODO2 is an annotation-based comparative genomics tool that searches for annotation terms, as defined in controlled dictionaries, associated with a quantitative phenotype across phenotypes.

KOMODO2 provides three main outputs as interactive HTML5 files:

 - Heatmaps

 - Scatterplots of q-values of annotation terms

 - Table of annotation terms and their statistics

To access these interactive visualizations please click on the `Results` button in the top bar.
